**Self-introduction**

Hello everyone. I am Kyungbo, a first year PhD student in Economics at the Uiversity of Geneva. I am interested in environment and behavior economics. I am taking the R-progrmming for Data Science course to improve my R skills so that I can delve into climate data more smoothly and efficiently.

## R Markdown Syntex
**Cache**

```{r computeA, cache=T}
a <- 10^4
```
```{r, cache=T}
(d <- a/10^3)
```
```{r, cache=T, dependson = "computeA"}
(d <- a/10^3)
```
**Simulation**

```{r}
b <- 100
x <- rnorm(b)
head(x)
median(x)
mean(x)
var(x)
```
The values seen above are slightly different from the theoretical ones (i.e. 0 and 1) since the random values were created by simulation. The values would get closer to 0 and 1 if we increase the sample size (i.e. b). It stems from the theorem **Law of Large Numbers**.

**Histogram**
```{r}
hist(x, main="Normal distribution")
```

**Equation**
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[var \{v_{1}(\hat{\theta},n) |\hat{\theta} \}] &=var \{v_{1}(\theta_{0}, n) \}+\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{O}_{p} \{D_{1}(\theta^{*},n)(\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}), \cdots , D_{p}(\theta^{*},n)(\theta-\theta_{0}) \}] \\
&= var \{v_{1}(\theta_{0}, n) \}+\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})
\end{align}

**In-line Equation**

$A$ is defined as $A \equiv [a_{i,j=1,\cdots,p}]$
